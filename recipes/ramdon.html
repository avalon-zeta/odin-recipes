    <h2>Description</2>
    <p>The infamous instant noodle dish topped with high end cubes of beef from the movie Parasite (2019).</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 packet of Neoguri (store bought)</li>
            <li>1 packet of Chapagetti (store bought)</li>
            <li>1 piece of Korean Hunu Sirloin (Japanese Kobe is a good substitute, or any fancy steak you’re feeling)</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim off some of the excess fat from the steak of your choice and cube it into bite-sized pieces. Sear the cubes in a saucepan with hot oil.</li>
            <li>In some shallow boiling water, place both sets of packaged noodles along with the spicy broth packets and frozen vegetable packets.</li>
            <li>After about 4 minutes, both the noodles and beef should be finished cooking. Drain all but ⅓  cup of the cooking broth and add the chapagetti’s packet of vegetable oil and bean sauce. Mix to combine, it will turn a muddy brown color.</li>
            <li>Add the beef to the noodles and stir. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
